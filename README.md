## Technical Details

### Book Object Structure

Each book is created using a constructor function with the following properties:

```javascript
function Book(title, author) {
    this.id = crypto.randomUUID();    // Unique identifier
    this.title = title;               // Book title
    this.author = author;             // Author name
    this.read = false;                // Read status (default: false)
}
```

### Key Functions

- **`Book(title, author)`**: Constructor for creating new book objects
- **`addBookToLibrary(bookData)`**: Adds a book to the library array
- **`displayLibrary()`**: Renders all books in the DOM
- **`removeBookFromLibrary(bookId)`**: Removes a book by its unique ID
- **`toggleReadStatus(bookId)`**: Toggles the read/unread status

### Data Storage

Currently, the library uses in-memory storage (JavaScript array). Books are not persisted between browser sessions.

## Browser Compatibility
